# abtests-significance-cr
Analyzing the statistical significance of A/B tests on conversion rate.
The goal of the project is to analyze the results of A/B testing using statistical methods in Python and create a visualization that shows key conversion metrics. 
The statistical significance for four metrics was calculated:
add_payment_info / session
add_shipping_info / session
begin_checkout / session
new_accounts / session

Significance was calculated by the total test results, and there are also results broken down by channels, continents, and devices.
